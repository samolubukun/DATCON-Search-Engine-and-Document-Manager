## Problem Description
The Procurement section of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) faces challenges in efficiently managing the profiles and documents of consultants and contractors. The manual process of maintaining this information leads to inefficiencies and potential errors. Lack of a comprehensive system for managing these profiles and documents hinders the procurement department's ability to evaluate and engage with consultants and contractors effectively.

### Challenges
1. **Inefficient profile management**: Manual registration and management of contractor and consultant profiles result in time-consuming processes and potential data inaccuracies.
2. **Document management**: There is a need for a system to scan and save relevant documents associated with contractors and consultants efficiently.
3. **Grading criteria**: The system should support grading contractors and consultants based on predefined criteria to evaluate their suitability for projects.
4. **Search capability**: The system needs robust search functionality to easily locate contractor and consultant profiles and associated documents.
5. **Security**: Ensure that the system provides adequate security measures to protect sensitive contractor and consultant data.
